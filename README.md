💻 Erggo Full Stack Interview Task – Submission by Siya Chugh This is my submission for the Erggo full-stack engineering interview task. I’ve built a complete full-stack web application that allows users to add and view a list of projects. The project features a responsive React + TypeScript frontend and a backend powered by Express and TypeScript. I’ve also included a short demo video to showcase the working app.

🔧 Tech Stack Frontend: React

TypeScript

Vite

Tailwind CSS

Backend: Express (TypeScript)

UUID

CORS

🧠 What I Implemented Sidebar toggle functionality

Project listing fetched from the backend

Project creation through a POST API

Responsive UI and clean structure

Type-safe interfaces throughout

To run the project locally, start by navigating into the Backend folder and running npm install to install the dependencies, followed by npm run dev to start the Express server on http://localhost:3000. In a separate terminal, navigate into the Frontend folder and run npm install as well, then start the development server using npm run dev. This will launch the React application on http://localhost:5173, which communicates with the backend to fetch and display project data.

🙋‍♀️ About Me Hi, I’m Siya Chugh — a passionate full-stack developer. I love building clean, interactive user experiences and writing robust backend logic. This task helped me showcase both frontend and backend skills together in a real-world structure.

Feel free to explore the project and reach out if needed!
